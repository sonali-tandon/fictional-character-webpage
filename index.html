            <p class="charactercontent">This is a fan page of fictional character Sherlock Holmes played by the actor
                Benedict Cumberbatch. The TV
                series
                - <cite><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1475582/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0" id="tvshowlink">Sherlock</a>
                    created by Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat,</cite>
                is based on the mystery novels written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The genre is a combination of mystery,
                crime
                and comedy. Sherlock stays at the famous address 221 Baker Street, London. Sherlock is a private
                detective
                and
                genius who investigates crime by looking for clues and being
                super observant. He is somewhat of a mind reader.

        <h2>Why I admire this character?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I relate to some parts of Sherlock's personality. Just like him, I have this strong urge of spending
                most of my time alone in my own company, just thinking about stuff. And even I have very few friends
                just like he does.
            </li>
            <li>I like the mystery genre in general and all the episodes are super exciting with a great plot twist.
                The story is well thought out.
            </li>
            <li>
                Apart from the character Sherlock, I am a big fan of Benedict Cumberbatch as well and I think he is
                an amazing actor and does justice to any role he portrays, especially this one.
